The French Republican calendar (French: calendrier républicain français), also commonly called the French Revolutionary calendar (calendrier révolutionnaire français), was a calendar created and implemented during the French Revolution, and used by the French government for about 12 years from late 1793 to 1805, and for 18 days by the Paris Commune in 1871, and meant to replace the Gregorian calendar [read more](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_calendar).
This application allows you to view the current date (using the Republican calendar), convert any Gregorian date to its Revolutionary equivalent, and convert a Revolutionary date back to the Gregorian calendar.
